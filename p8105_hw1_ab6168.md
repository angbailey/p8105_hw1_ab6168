```

# Problem 1

## Description of dataset

- The variables in the dataset are origin, year, month, day, hour, temp,
  dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib,
  time_hour
- The dataset has 358 rows and 15 columns.
- The mean temperature is 39.5821229.

## Scatter plot of Time vs.Â Temp

``` r
ggp_weather = ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = humid))

ggp_weather
```

The scatter plot shows that temperature generally increases over time,
having an overall upward trend with day to day variability. In higher
temperatures, there is higher humidity and in lower temperatures, while
lower humidity is more frequent at lower temperatures.

# Problem 2

## Creating Dataframe

``` r
df = tibble(
  samp = rnorm(10),
  greater_0 = samp > 0,
  vec_char = character(length = 10),
  vec_factor = factor(rep(c("level1", "level2", "level3"), length = 10))
)
```

## Mean of Variables

**Sample mean**

``` r
mean_samp = mean(pull(df, samp))
mean_samp
```

    ## [1] 0.5008824

**Logical vector mean**

``` r
mean_greater_0 = mean(pull(df, greater_0))
mean_greater_0
```

    ## [1] 0.6

**Character vector mean**

``` r
mean_vec_char = mean(pull(df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_vec_char
```

    ## [1] NA

**Factor vector mean**

``` r
mean_vec_factor = mean(pull(df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_vec_factor
```

    ## [1] NA

The sample and logical vector variables return a mean, while the
character vector and factor vector variables return NA.

**Converting character, logical, and factor variables**

``` r
numeric_char = as.numeric(pull(df,vec_char))
numeric_log = as.numeric(pull(df,greater_0))
numeric_fac = as.numeric(pull(df,vec_factor))
```

After applying the as.numeric function, the elements in the logical
variable are assigned 0 or 1. The elements in the factor variable are
assigned 1,2, or 3. And the elements in the character variable are each
assigned NA. The as.numeric function converts the object to a numeric
data type. This explains what happens when trying to take the mean as
the argument was not a numeric vector.
